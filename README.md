# corona-helpers
A utility that helps with adding some functionality other programming languages contain or shortcuts to the most frequently reused functions I've encountered while using Corona/Lua thus far.

```lua
local utility = require 'utility'

print(utility.firstToUpper('awesome')) -- Awesome

```
